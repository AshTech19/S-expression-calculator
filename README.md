S-expression calculator
=======================

Write a command line program that acts as a simple calculator: it takes a
single argument as an expression and prints out the integer result of
evaluating it.

Assuming the program is implemented in Python, invocations should look like:

    $ ./calc.py 123
    123

    $ ./calc.py "(add 12 12)"
    24

You're free to use whatever programming language you like, the invocation above
is just an example. The general point of taking an argument and printing out
its evaluation is the only contract to abide by.

Expression syntax
-----------------

Since the expression is passed in as a command line argument, it is a string.
The syntax resembles [S-expressions][sexp] but the rules are simplified. An
expression can be in one of two forms:

### Integers

An integer is just a sequence of base 10 digits. For example:

    123

### Function calls

A function call takes the following form:

    (FUNCTION EXPR EXPR)

A function call is always delimited by parenthesis `(` and `)`.

The `FUNCTION` is one of `add` or `multiply`.

The `EXPR` can be any arbitrary expression, i.e. it can be further function
calls or integer expressions.

Exactly one space is used to separate each term.

For example:

    (add 123 456)

    (multiply (add 1 2) 3)

Expression grammar
------------------

A formal grammar specified in [EBNF][ebnf]:

    DIGIT = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";

    EXPR = INTEGER | ADD | MULTIPLY;

    INTEGER = DIGIT, { DIGIT };

    ADD = "(", "a", "d", "d", " ", EXPR, " ", EXPR, ")";

    MULTIPLY = "(", "m", "u", "l", "t", "i", "p", "l", "y", " ", EXPR, " ", EXPR, ")";

Expression semantics
--------------------

The goal is to write an integer calculator that supports the `add` and
`multiply` functions. The program should take an expression string as a command
line argument and print out the result of evaluating the expression.

The examples follow the convention:

    INPUT
    OUTPUT

Where `INPUT` is the expression string passed as a single argument and `OUTPUT`
is the output printed to stdout by your program.

### Integers

Integers should be evaluated as the number they represent:

    123
    123

    0
    0

### Add

The `add` function should:

1. accept exactly 2 sub-expressions
2. fully evaluate the 2 sub-expressions
3. return the result of adding the 2 sub-expressions together

```
(add 1 1)
2

(add 0 (add 3 4))
7

(add 3 (add (add 3 3) 3))
12
```

### Multiply

The `multiply` function should:

1. accept exactly 2 sub-expressions
2. fully evaluate the 2 sub-expressions
3. return the result of multiplying the 2 sub-expressions together

```
(multiply 1 1)
1

(multiply 0 (multiply 3 4))
0

(multiply 2 (multiply 3 4))
24

(multiply 3 (multiply (multiply 3 3) 3))
81
```

Examples
--------

Besides the examples already provided above, it should be possible to mix and
match integers and function calls to build arbitrary calculations:

    (add 1 (multiply 2 3))
    7

    (multiply 2 (add (multiply 2 3) 8))
    28
